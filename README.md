## Low-Code-No-Code-Langflow

**Enterprise-ready custom components and templates for [Langflow](https://langflow.org/), built with data privacy and security as the top priority.**

### Our Vision

This repository is building a family of robust, ready-to-use Langflow nodes and templates. Our mission is to empower corporates and other industries to integrate powerful AI workflows **without being afraid of data leaks** or compromising sensitive company information.

We believe in secure, on-premise AI. These components are designed to operate entirely within your own infrastructure, giving you full control over your data.

### Key Features & Focus

  * 🔒 **Privacy-First:** Components are designed to run locally, connect to on-premise models (like local LLaMA, Mistral), and avoid unnecessary external API calls.
  * 🏢 **Enterprise-Grade:** Practical, real-world templates for common business tasks (e.g., private RAG, data analysis on internal documents, internal-facing agents).
  * 🔌 **Internal Connectors:** Custom nodes for securely interacting with your internal databases, vector stores, and other private services.
  * 🚀 **Accelerate Adoption:** Enable both technical and non-technical teams to build and deploy generative AI applications safely using Langflow's visual, low-code interface.

### Who is this for?

  * **IT/Security Teams** wanting to provide a safe "AI sandbox" for their company.
  * **Data Science & Engineering Teams** building internal applications on sensitive corporate data.
  * **Corporates** in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, legal) that cannot risk third-party data exposure.
  * **Developers** who want to quickly build internal AI prototypes without configuring complex security protocols from scratch.
